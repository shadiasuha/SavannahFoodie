# Project Three - Savannah Foodie

The inspiration for this project stems from years of foodie adventures that I had with my best friend in Chicago. I moved away from home at 17 to pursue my undergraduate studies in Ohio, and then to Chicago for further studies and to build my career. Of the 26 years that I lived in Chicago, we spent 11 of them going on local and out-of-town foodie adventures, and our phone cameras always ate before we did. :D We talked about starting a blog that we would call 'Shorty and Sha' to document our experiences, but we never made it happen. Our memories stayed in our minds, hearts, and phones. After returning home a few years ago, I discovered that a lot had changed and developed over the 30 years I was away. While Savannah has roughly 6% of the population of Chicago and is significantly smaller in size, it has a thriving foodie scene. The restaurants in this project include some that I've visited myself and others that have been recommended to me. With so many options to choose from, I can happily continue my foodie adventures, even if Shorty is no longer near.
